"""
Starting with the z14-ZR1 and LinuxONE Rockhopper II machine generations, the
"dpm-storage-management" firmware feature has been introduced to support a
simpler management of FCP and FICON (=ECKD) storage for DPM mode. If machines
of these generations are in DPM mode, the feature is always enabled and cannot
be disabled.

When the "dpm-storage-management" feature is enabled, :term:`storage group`
and :term:`storage volume` resources can be defined on the HMC, and can cause
fulfillment requests to be sent via email to storage administrators.
Once these requests are satisfied on the actual storage subsystem and possibly
SAN switches, the changes are automatically discovered by DPM and reflected
in the state of these resources. Thus, the allocation of actual storage volumes
on the storage subsystem is not performed by DPM.

The sending of email is optional, and if the changes are done by some
automation tool, they will also be discovered automatically. That way, the
whole process of allocating and attaching volumes can be fully automated, if
so desired.

The top level resource objects are :term:`storage groups <storage group>`.
Storage groups are defined globally at the HMC level, and are associated with a
CPC. They can only be associated with one CPC at a time. In the zhmcclient, the
:class:`~zhmcclient.StorageGroup` objects are accessible via the
:attr:`~zhmcclient.ConsoleManager.storage_groups` property.

Storage groups are a grouping mechanism for
:term:`storage volumes <storage volume>`. An FCP-type storage
group can contain only FCP type storage volumes, and a FICON-type storage
group can contain only FICON/ECKD type storage volumes.

Attachment and detachment of volumes to a partition happens at the level of
storage groups, and always applies to all volumes defined in the storage group.

The storage-related z/Architecture devices that are visible to a partition are
different for the two storage architectures: For FCP, the virtualized HBA is
visible as a device, and the storage volumes (LUNs) are not represented as
devices. For FICON, each ECKD volume is visible as a device, but the
virtualized FICON adapter port is not represented as a device. When the
"dpm-storage-management" feature is enabled, each storage-related
z/Architecture device that is visible to a partition is represented as a
:term:`virtual storage resource` object. The virtual storage resource objects
are instantiated automatically when a storage group is attached to a partition.
The :term:`HBA` resource objects known from DPM mode before the introduction of
the "dpm-storage-management" feature are not exposed anymore (their equivalent
are now the :term:`virtual storage resource` objects).

Single storage volumes cannot be attached to partitions, only entire storage
groups can be. In fact, storage volume objects do not even exist outside the
scope of storage groups.
A particular storage volume can be contained in only one storage group.

Storage groups can be listed, created, deleted, and updated, and their storage
volumes can also be listed, created, deleted, and updated.

Storage groups can be attached to zero or more partitions. Attachment to
multiple partitions at the same time is possible for storage groups that are
defined to be shareable. In case of multiple attachments of a storage group, it
contains the storage volume objects only once for all attachments, but the
virtual storage resource objects are instantiated separately for each
attachment.

Storage groups can only be associated with CPCs that have the
"dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.

        Add a list of storage adapter ports to this storage group's candidate
        adapter ports list.

        This operation only applies to storage groups of type "fcp".

        These adapter ports become candidates for use as backing adapters when
        creating virtual storage resources when the storage group is attached
        to a partition. The adapter ports should have connectivity to the
        storage area network (SAN).

        Candidate adapter ports may only be added before the CPC discovers a
        working communications path, indicated by a "verified" status on at
        least one of this storage group's WWPNs. After that point, all
        adapter ports in the storage group are automatically detected and
        manually adding them is no longer possible.

        Because the CPC discovers working communications paths automatically,
        candidate adapter ports do not need to be added by the user. Any
        ports that are added, are validated by the CPC during discovery,
        and may or may not actually be used.

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to this storage group.
        * Object-access permission to the adapter of each specified port.
        * Task permission to the "Configure Storage - System Programmer" task.

        Parameters:

        Perform Logical Unit Number (LUN) discovery for this FCP storage group.
        The corresponding HMC operation is "Start FCP Storage Discovery".

        This operation only applies to storage groups of type "fcp".

        The HMC performs the LUN discovery in an asynchronous job. This method
        supports waiting for completion of the job and thus the LUN discovery,
        or returning immediately after the HMC has started the asynchronous job.

        When the LUN discovery is completed, a connection report will have
        been created that reflects the results of the discovery. The
        connection report can be retrieved with
        :meth:`~zhmcclient.StorageGroup.get_connection_report`. It is
        recommended to retrieve the connection report and verify that it
        reports correct volumes.

        * Object-access permission to this storage group.
        * Task permission to the "Configure Storage - System Programmer" task

        Parameters:

          force_restart (bool):
            Indicates if there is an in-progress discovery operation for the
            specified storage group, it should be terminated and started again.
            If `False` or there is no in-progress discovery operation for the
            specified storage group, a new one is started.

          wait_for_completion (bool):
            Boolean controlling whether this method should wait for completion
            of the asynchronous job performing the LUN discovery.

          operation_timeout (:term:`number`):
            Timeout in seconds, for waiting for completion of the asynchronous
            job performing the LUN discovery. The special value 0 means that no
            timeout is set. `None` means that the default async operation
            timeout of the session is used. If the timeout expires when
            `wait_for_completion=True`, a
            :exc:`~zhmcclient.OperationTimeout` is raised.

        Returns:

          `None` or :class:`~zhmcclient.Job`:

            If `wait_for_completion` is `True`, returns nothing.

            If `wait_for_completion` is `False`, returns a
            :class:`~zhmcclient.Job` object representing the asynchronously
            executing job on the HMC.
