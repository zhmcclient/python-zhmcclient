A :term:`User Role` resource represents an authority role which can be assigned
to one or more HMC users.

A User Role may allow access to specific managed objects, classes of managed
objects, groups and/or tasks. There are two types of User Roles: user-defined
and system-defined. User-defined User Roles are created by an HMC user, whereas
the system-defined User Roles are pre-defined, standard User Roles supplied
with the HMC.
