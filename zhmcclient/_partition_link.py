A :term:`Partition Link` interconnects two or more
:term:`Partitions <Partition>` that share the same network configuration.

Partition Links have been introduced with SE 2.16. Conceptually, Partition Links
can connect different :term:`CPCs <CPC>`. However, the implementation is
currently limited to the same DPM-enabled CPC. Currently, one Partition Link
resource is always associated with a single CPC at any time.

Partition Links are based on different technologies, indicated in their
``type`` property:

* ``smc-d`` - Shared Memory Communications - Direct Memory Access (SMC-D)
  (Version 2 or later).
  Support for this technology is indicated via :ref:`API feature <API features>`
  "dpm-smcd-partition-link-management".
* ``hipersockets`` - Hipersockets.
  Support for this technology is indicated via :ref:`API feature <API features>`
  "dpm-hipersockets-partition-link-management".
* ``ctc`` - FICON Channel to Channel (CTC) interconnect, using corresponding
  cabling between FICON adapters.
  Support for this technology is indicated via :ref:`API feature <API features>`
  "dpm-ctc-partition-link-management".

Partition Links have a ``state`` property that indicates their current
attachment state to any partitions:

* ``complete`` - All requests for attaching or detaching the partition link to
  or from partitions are complete, and the partition link is attached to 2 or
  more partitions.
* ``incomplete`` - All requests for attaching or detaching the partition link to
  or from partitions are complete, but the partition link is attached to less
  than 2 partitions.
* ``updating`` - Some requests for attaching or detaching the partition link to
  or from partitions are incomplete.

This section describes the interface for Partition Links using resource class
:class:`~zhmcclient.PartitionLink` and the corresponding manager class
:class:`~zhmcclient.PartitionLinkManager`.

Because conceptually, Partition Links can connect different CPCs, this client
has designed :class:`~zhmcclient.PartitionLink` resources to be available
through the :class:`~zhmcclient.Console` resource, via its
:attr:`~zhmcclient.Console.partition_links` property.

The earlier interfaces for Hipersockets are also supported:

* represented as :class:`~zhmcclient.Adapter`, including support for creation
  and deletion.
* Attachment to a partition is managed via creation and deletion of
  :class:`~zhmcclient.Nic` resources on the partition.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For
        details about filter arguments, see :ref:`Filtering`.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the HMC List operation is performed with the subset of the
          provided filter arguments that can be handled on the HMC side and the
          remaining filter arguments are applied on the client side on the list
          result.

        Parameters:

          full_properties (bool):

            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see
            :ref:`Filtering`.

            `None` causes no filtering to happen.

        to and from partitions, by modifying the appropriate resource
        properties.

        This method serializes with other methods that access or change
        properties on the same Python object.

        This method performs the "Modify Partition Link" HMC operation and
        waits for completion of its asynchronous job.

        HMC/SE version requirements:

        * SE version >= 2.16.0
        * for technology-specific support, see the API features described in
          :ref:`Partition Links`

        Authorization requirements:

        * Task permission to the "Create Partition Link" task.
        * Object-access permission to all Partitions for the initially requested
          attachments.
        * Object-access permission to all FICON adapter objects used for the
          CTC connections for the initially requested attachments.

        Parameters:

          properties (dict): New values for the properties to be updated.
            Properties not to be updated are omitted.
            Allowable properties are listed for operation
            'Modify Partition Link' in section 'Partition Link object' in the
            :term:`HMC API` book.

        Raises:

          :exc:`~zhmcclient.ParseError`
          :exc:`~zhmcclient.AuthError`

          :exc:`~zhmcclient.OperationTimeout`: The timeout expired while
            waiting for completion of the operation.
