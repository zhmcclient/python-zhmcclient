"""
An :term:`Activation Profile` controls the activation of a :term:`CPC`
or :term:`LPAR`. They are used to tailor the operation of a CPC and are
stored in the Support Element associated with the CPC.

Activation Profile resources are contained in CPC resources.

Activation Profile resources only exist in CPCs that are not in DPM mode.

TODO: If Reset Activation Profiles are used to determine the CPC mode,
      should they not exist in all CPC modes?

There are three types of Activation Profiles:

1. Reset:
   The Reset Activation Profile defines for a CPC the mode in which the CPC
   licensed internal code will be loaded (e.g. DPM mode or classic mode) and
   how much central storage and expanded storage will be used.

2. Image:
   For CPCs in classic mode, each LPAR can have an Image Activation Profile.
   The Image Activation Profile determines the number of CPs that the LPAR will
   use and whether these CPs will be dedicated to the LPAR or shared. It also
   allows assigning the amount of central storage and expanded storage that
   will be used by each LPAR.

3. Load:
   For CPCs in classic mode, each LPAR can have a Load Activation Profile.
   The Load Activation Profile defines the channel address of the device that
   the operating system for that LPAR will be loaded (booted) from.
