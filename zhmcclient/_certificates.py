A :term:`Certificate` represents an X.509 certificate.

Certificates are top level resources, but at this point, only certificates of
type "secure-boot" are supported. Such certificates are always associated to a
specific :term:`CPC`. They can only be used if the API feature
"secure-boot-with-certificates" is available on both, :term:`HMC` and
:term:`CPC`.

They can be assigned to one or more :term:`LPAR`, :term:`Partition`, or
:term:`Image Activation Profile` to be used during the load/start of the
corresponding entities when doing a "secure boot" load for an LPAR, respectively
a Partition start.
