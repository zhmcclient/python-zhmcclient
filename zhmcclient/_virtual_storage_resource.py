"""
A :term:`virtual storage resource` object represents a storage-related
z/Architecture device that is visible to a partition and that provides access
for that partition to a :term:`storage volume`.

The storage-related z/Architecture devices that are visible to a partition are
different for the two storage architectures: For FCP, the virtualized HBA is
visible as a device, and the storage volumes (LUNs) are not represented as
devices. For FICON, each ECKD volume is visible as a device, but the
virtualized FICON adapter port is not represented as a device.

What the virtual storage resource objects represent, therefore depends on
the storage architecture of the storage volume they are used for:

* For FCP, a virtual storage resource object represents the virtualized HBA
  in the partition that is used to access the LUN. However, each usage of
  the virtual HBA in context of a storage group has its own virtual storage
  resource object.
* For FICON, a virtual storage resource object represents the ECKD volume.

Virtual storage resource objects are instantiated automatically when a storage
group is attached to a partition, and are removed automatically upon
detachment.

The :term:`HBA` resource objects known from DPM mode before introduction of the
"dpm-storage-management" feature are no longer exposed.

Virtual storage resource objects are contained in :term:`storage group`
objects.

Storage groups and storage volumes only can be defined in CPCs that are in
DPM mode and that have the "dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.
