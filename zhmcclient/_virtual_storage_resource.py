"""
A :term:`virtual storage resource` object represents a storage-related
z/Architecture device that is visible to a partition and that provides access
for that partition to a :term:`storage volume`.

The storage-related z/Architecture devices that are visible to a partition are
different for the two storage architectures: For FCP, the virtualized HBA is
visible as a device, and the storage volumes (LUNs) are not represented as
devices. For FICON, each ECKD volume is visible as a device, but the
virtualized FICON adapter port is not represented as a device.

What the virtual storage resource objects represent, therefore depends on
the storage architecture of the storage volume they are used for:

* For FCP, a virtual storage resource object represents the virtualized HBA
  in the partition that is used to access the LUN. However, each usage of
  the virtual HBA in context of a storage group has its own virtual storage
  resource object.
* For FICON, a virtual storage resource object represents the ECKD volume.

Virtual storage resource objects are instantiated automatically when a storage
group is attached to a partition, and are removed automatically upon
detachment.

The :term:`HBA` resource objects known from DPM mode before introduction of the
"dpm-storage-management" feature are no longer exposed.

Virtual storage resource objects are contained in :term:`storage group`
objects.

Storage groups and storage volumes only can be defined in CPCs that are in
DPM mode and that have the "dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.

        List the virtual storage resources in this storage group.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For
        details about filter arguments, see :ref:`Filtering`.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the HMC List operation is performed with the subset of the
          provided filter arguments that can be handled on the HMC side and the
          remaining filter arguments are applied on the client side on the list
          result.

        Authorization requirements:

          full_properties (bool):
            Controls that the full set of resource properties for each returned

            set: "element-uri", "name", "device-number", "adapter-port-uri",

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see

            `None` causes no filtering to happen, i.e. all resources are
