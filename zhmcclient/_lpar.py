A :term:`LPAR` (Logical Partition) is a subset of the hardware resources of a
:term:`CPC` in classic mode (or ensemble mode), virtualized as a separate
computer.

LPARs cannot be created or deleted by the user; they can only be listed.

LPAR resources are contained in CPC resources.

LPAR resources only exist in CPCs that are in classic mode (or ensemble mode).
CPCs in DPM mode have :term:`Partition` resources, instead.

            an additional acceptable end status when `wait_for_completion` is
            set.

          activation_profile_name (:term:`string`):
            Name of the image :class:`ActivationProfile` to use for activation.

            `None` means that the activation profile specified in the
            `next-activation-profile-name` property of the LPAR is used.

            set.

          secure_boot (bool):
            Boolean controlling whether the system checks the software
            signature of what is loaded against what the distributor signed it
