"""
A :term:`User Pattern` resource represents a pattern for HMC user IDs that are
not defined on the HMC but can be verified by an LDAP server for user
authentication.

User Patterns and user templates allow a system administrator to define a group
of HMC users at once whose user IDs all match a certain pattern (for example,
a regular expression) and who have a certain set of attributes. Each pattern
identifies a template User object which defines many characteristics of such
users. A successful logon with a user ID that matches a User Pattern results in
the creation of a pattern-based user, with many of its attributes coming from
the associated template.

User Patterns are searched in a defined order during logon processing. That
order can be customized through the
:meth:`~zhmcclient.UserPatternManager.reorder` method.

        List the :term:`User Pattern` resources representing the user patterns
        defined in this HMC.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For
        details about filter arguments, see :ref:`Filtering`.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the HMC List operation is performed with the subset of the
          provided filter arguments that can be handled on the HMC side and the
          remaining filter arguments are applied on the client side on the list
          result.

        Authorization requirements:

        * User-related-access permission to the User Pattern objects included
          in the result, or task permission to the "Manage User Patterns" task.

        Parameters:

          full_properties (bool):
            Controls whether the full set of resource properties should be
            retrieved, vs. only the short set as returned by the list
            operation.

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see
            :ref:`Filtering`.

            `None` causes no filtering to happen, i.e. all resources are
            returned.
