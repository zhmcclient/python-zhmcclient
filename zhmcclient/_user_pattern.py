"""
A :term:`User Pattern` resource represents a pattern for HMC user IDs that are
not defined on the HMC but can be verified by an LDAP server for user
authentication.

User Patterns and user templates allow a system administrator to define a group
of HMC users at once whose user IDs all match a certain pattern (for example,
a regular expression) and who have a certain set of attributes. Each pattern
identifies a template User object which defines many characteristics of such
users. A successful logon with a user ID that matches a User Pattern results in
the creation of a pattern-based user, with many of its attributes coming from
the associated template.

User Patterns are searched in a defined order during logon processing. That
order can be customized through the
:meth:`~zhmcclient.UserPatternManager.reorder` method.
