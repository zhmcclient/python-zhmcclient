"""
A :term:`Group` is a user-defined group of resources that are managed by the
HMC.

Groups can be used for example in User Role permissions.

Groups can be one of two kinds:

* pattern-matching groups: Membership is implicit and the result of pattern
  matching on the resource name. This is supported only for members that are
  CPCs, Logical Partitions (i.e. classic mode), or other Groups.

* explicit groups: Each member is added and removed explicitly, using the
  :meth:`Group.add_member` and :meth:`Group.remove_member` methods.
