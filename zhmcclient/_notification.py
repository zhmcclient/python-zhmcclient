The HMC supports the publishing of notifications for specific topics. This
includes for example asynchronous job completion, property or status changes,
and operating system messages issued in an LPAR or DPM partition.

The zhmcclient package supports receiving HMC notifications in an easy-to-use
way, as shown in the following example that receives and displays OS messages
for a DPM partition::

    import zhmcclient

    hmc = ...
    userid = ...
    password = ...

    session = zhmcclient.Session(hmc, userid, password)
    client = zhmcclient.Client(session)
    cpc = client.cpcs.find(name=cpcname)
    partition = cpc.partitions.find(name=partname)

    topic = partition.open_os_message_channel(include_refresh_messages=True)

    print("Subscribing for OS messages for partition %s on CPC %s using "
          "notifications..." % (partition.name, cpc.name))

    receiver = zhmcclient.NotificationReceiver(topic, hmc, userid, password)

    try:
        for headers, message in receiver.notifications():
            print("HMC notification #%s:" % headers['session-sequence-nr'])
            os_msg_list = message['os-messages']
            for os_msg in os_msg_list:
                msg_txt = os_msg['message-text'].strip('\\n')
                msg_id = os_msg['message-id']
                print("OS message #%s:\\n%s" % (msg_id, msg_txt))
    except zhmcclient.NotificationError as exc:
        print("Notification Error: {}".format(exc))
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("Keyboard Interrupt - Leaving notification receiver loop...")
    finally:
        print("Closing notification receiver...")
        receiver.close()

When running this example code in one terminal, and stopping or starting
the partition in another terminal, one can monitor the shutdown or boot
messages issued by the operating system. The following commands use the
``zhmc`` CLI provided in the :term:`zhmccli project` to do that:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc partition stop {cpc-name} {partition-name}
    $ zhmc partition start {cpc-name} {partition-name}

    Notification topic strings are created by the HMC in context of a

    However, these topic strings can be used by any JMS message listener that
    knows the topic string and that authenticates under some valid HMC userid.
    The HMC userid used by the JMS listener does not need to be the one that
    was used for the client session in which the notification topic was

            Some important header fields (dict items) are:

            * 'notification-type' (string): The HMC notification type (e.g.
              'os-message', 'job-completion', or others).

            * 'session-sequence-nr' (string): The sequence number of this HMC
              notification within the session created by this notification
              receiver object. This number starts at 0 when this receiver
              object is created, and is incremented each time an HMC
              notification is published to this receiver.

            * 'class' (string): The class name of the HMC resource publishing
              the HMC notification (e.g. 'partition').

            * 'object-id' (string) or 'element-id' (string): The ID of the HMC
              resource publishing the HMC notification.

            For a complete list of notification header fields, see section
            "Message format" in chapter 4. "Asynchronous notification" in the
            :term:`HMC API` book.

          * message (:term:`JSON object`): Body of the HMC notification,
            converted into a JSON object. `None` for notifications that
            have no content in their response body.

            The properties of the JSON object vary by notification type.
