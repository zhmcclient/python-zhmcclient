The HMC supports the publishing of notifications for specific topics. This
includes for example asynchronous job completion, property or status changes,
and operating system messages issued in an LPAR or DPM partition.

The zhmcclient package supports receiving HMC notifications in an easy-to-use
way, as shown in the following example that receives and displays OS messages
for a DPM partition::

    import zhmcclient

    hmc = ...
    userid = ...
    password = ...

    session = zhmcclient.Session(hmc, userid, password)
    client = zhmcclient.Client(session)
    cpc = client.cpcs.find(name=cpcname)
    partition = cpc.partitions.find(name=partname)

    topic = partition.open_os_message_channel(include_refresh_messages=True)

    print("Subscribing for OS messages for partition %s on CPC %s using "
          "notifications..." % (partition.name, cpc.name))

    receiver = zhmcclient.NotificationReceiver(
        topic, hmc, session.session_id, session.session_credential)

    while True:
        try:
            for headers, message in receiver.notifications():
                print("HMC notification #%s:" % headers['session-sequence-nr'])
                os_msg_list = message['os-messages']
                for os_msg in os_msg_list:
                    msg_txt = os_msg['message-text'].strip('\\n')
                    msg_id = os_msg['message-id']
                    print("OS message #%s:\\n%s" % (msg_id, msg_txt))
        except zhmcclient.NotificationError as exc:
            print("Notification Error: {} - reconnecting".format(exc))
            continue
        except stomp.exception.StompException as exc:
            print("STOMP Error: {} - reconnecting".format(exc))
            continue
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Keyboard Interrupt - leaving")
            receiver.close()
            break
        else:
            print("Receiver has been closed  - leaving")
            break

When running this example code in one terminal, and stopping or starting
the partition in another terminal, one can monitor the shutdown or boot
messages issued by the operating system. The following commands use the
``zhmc`` CLI provided in the :term:`zhmccli project` to do that:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc partition stop {cpc-name} {partition-name}
    $ zhmc partition start {cpc-name} {partition-name}

        For all parameters, `None` means that this object does not specify a
        value for the parameter, and that a default value will be used
        (see :ref:`Constants`).

        All parameters are available as instance attributes.

        Parameters:

          connect_timeout (:term:`number`): STOMP connect timeout in seconds.
            This timeout applies to making a connection at the socket level.
            The special value 0 means that no timeout is set.

          connect_retries (:term:`integer`): Number of retries (after the
            initial attempt) for STOMP connection-related issues. These retries
            are performed for failed DNS lookups, failed socket connections, and
            socket connection timeouts.
            The special value -1 means that there are infinite retries.

          reconnect_sleep_initial (:term:`number`): Initial STOMP reconnect
            sleep delay in seconds. The reconnect sleep delay is the time to
            wait before reconnecting.

          reconnect_sleep_increase (:term:`number`): Factor by which the
            reconnect sleep delay is increased after each connection attempt.
            For example, 0.5 means to wait 50% longer than before the previous
            attempt, 1.0 means wait twice as long, and 0.0 means keep the delay
            constant.

          reconnect_sleep_max (:term:`number`): Maximum reconnect sleep delay
            in seconds, regardless of the `reconnect_sleep_increase` value.

          reconnect_sleep_jitter (:term:`number`): Random additional time to
            wait before a reconnect to avoid stampeding, as a percentage of the
            current reconnect sleep delay. For example, a value of 0.1 means to
            wait an extra 0%-10% of the delay calculated using the previous
            three parameters.

          keepalive (bool): Enable keepalive at the socket level.

          heartbeat_send_cycle (:term:`number`): Cycle time in which the client
            will send heartbeats to the HMC, in seconds.
            This time is sent to the HMC as the minimum cycle time the client
            can do, and the HMC returns that time as the cycle time in which it
            wants to receive heartbeats.
            The cycle time should not be less than 0.2 sec; a few seconds is
            a reasonable value.
            The special value 0 disables the sending of heartbeats to the HMC.

          heartbeat_receive_cycle (:term:`number`): Cycle time in which the
            HMC will send heartbeats to the client, in seconds.
            This time is sent to the HMC as the cycle time in which the client
            wants to receive heartbeats, and the HMC uses that time to send
            heartbeats.
            The cycle time should not be less than 0.2 sec; a few seconds is
            a reasonable value.
            The special value 0 disables heartbeat sending by the HMC and
            checking on the client side.

          heartbeat_receive_check (:term:`number`): Additional time for
            checking the heartbeats received from the HMC on the client,
            as a percentage of the 'heartbeat_receive_cycle' time.
            For example, a value of 0.5 means to wait an extra 50% of the
            'heartbeat_receive_cycle' time.
            This value should not be less than 0.5, and a value of 1 or 2 is
            a reasonable value.

        Generator method that yields all HMC notifications (= JMS messages)
        received by this notification receiver.

        The method connects to the HMC if needed, so after raising
        :exc:`~zhmcclient.NotificationConnectionError` or
        :exc:`stomp.exception.StompException`, it can simply be called
        again to reconnect and resume waiting for notifications.

        This method returns only when the receiver is closed
        (using :meth:`~zhmcclient.NotificationRecever.close`) by some other
        thread; any errors do not cause the method to return but always cause
        an exception to be raised.

        For an example how to use this method, see
        :ref:`Notifications` or the example scripts.

        Yields:

          : A tuple (headers, message) representing one HMC notification, with:

          * headers (dict): The notification header fields.

            Some important header fields (dict items) are:

            * 'notification-type' (string): The HMC notification type (e.g.
              'os-message', 'job-completion', or others).

            * 'session-sequence-nr' (string): The sequence number of this HMC
              notification within the session created by this notification
              receiver object. This number starts at 0 when this receiver
              object is created, and is incremented each time an HMC
              notification is published to this receiver.

            * 'class' (string): The class name of the HMC resource publishing
              the HMC notification (e.g. 'partition').

            * 'object-id' (string) or 'element-id' (string): The ID of the HMC
              resource publishing the HMC notification.

            For a complete list of notification header fields, see section
            "Message format" in chapter 4. "Asynchronous notification" in the
            :term:`HMC API` book.

          * message (:term:`JSON object`): Body of the HMC notification,
            converted into a JSON object. `None` for notifications that
            have no content in their response body.

            The properties of the JSON object vary by notification type.

            For a description of the JSON properties, see the sub-sections
            for each notification type within section "Notification message
            formats" in chapter 4. "Asynchronous notification" in the
            :term:`HMC API` book.
