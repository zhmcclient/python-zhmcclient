    A class that automatically updates

    * the properties of zhmcclient resource objects that are enabled for
      auto-updating
    * the list of zhmcclient resource objects in manager objects that are
      enabled for auto-updating

    based on respective notifications from the HMC.

    **Experimental:** This class is considered experimental at this point, and
    its API may change incompatibly as long as it is experimental.

    Note: The user should not create any objects of this class nor invoke any
    methods of this class, because the objects are created automatically
    when a :class:`~zhmcclient.Session` object is subscribed for
    auto-updating via its :meth:`~zhmcclient.Session.subscribe_auto_update`
    method.

    Creating an object of this class performs a logon to the HMC to retrieve
    the notification topics, and then establishes a JMS session with the HMC and
    subscribes for the object notification topic of the session. This causes
    the HMC to emit status notifications, property notifications, and inventory
    notifications, which are processed by this class and cause the updates
    to happen.

    Resource objects can be enabled for auto-updating via their
    :meth:`~zhmcclient.BaseResource.enable_auto_update` method.

    Manager objects can be enabled for auto-updating via their
    :meth:`~zhmcclient.BaseManager.enable_auto_update` method.

    Zhmcclient resource objects or manager objects that are not enabled for
    auto-updating remain unchanged.
