        List the :term:`Task` resources representing the tasks defined in this
        HMC.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For
        details about filter arguments, see :ref:`Filtering`.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the HMC List operation is performed with the subset of the
          provided filter arguments that can be handled on the HMC side and the
          remaining filter arguments are applied on the client side on the list
          result.

        Authorization requirements:

        * None

        Parameters:

          full_properties (bool):
            Controls whether the full set of resource properties should be
            retrieved, vs. only the short set as returned by the list
            operation.

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see
            :ref:`Filtering`.

            `None` causes no filtering to happen, i.e. all resources are
            returned.

        Returns:

          : A list of :class:`~zhmcclient.Task` objects.

        Raises:
