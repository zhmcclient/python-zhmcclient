        If the adapter does not have any ports, an empty list is returned.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For
        details about filter arguments, see :ref:`Filtering`.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the corresponding array property for this resource in the
          parent object is used to list the resources, and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to this Adapter.

        Parameters:

          full_properties (bool):
            Controls whether the full set of resource properties should be
            retrieved, vs. only the short set as returned by the list
            operation.

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see
            :ref:`Filtering`.

            `None` causes no filtering to happen, i.e. all resources are
            returned.
