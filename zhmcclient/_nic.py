A :term:`NIC` (Network Interface Card) is a logical entity that provides a
:term:`Partition` with access to external communication networks through a
:term:`Network Adapter`. More specifically, a NIC connects a Partition with a
:term:`Network Port`, or with a :term:`Virtual Switch` which then connects to
the Network Port.

NIC resources are contained in Partition resources.

NICs only exist in :term:`CPCs <CPC>` that are in DPM mode.

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the corresponding array property for this resource in the

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see

        Create and configure a NIC in this Partition.

        The NIC must be backed by an adapter port (on an OSA, ROCE, or
        Hipersockets adapter).

        The way the backing adapter port is specified in the "properties"
        parameter of this method depends on the adapter type, as follows:

        * For OSA and Hipersockets adapters, the "virtual-switch-uri"
          property is used to specify the URI of the virtual switch that is
          associated with the backing adapter port.

          This virtual switch is a resource that automatically exists as soon
          as the adapter resource exists. Note that these virtual switches do
          not show up in the HMC GUI; but they do show up at the HMC REST API
          and thus also at the zhmcclient API as the
          :class:`~zhmcclient.VirtualSwitch` class.

          The value for the "virtual-switch-uri" property can be determined
          from a given adapter name and port index as shown in the following
          example code (omitting any error handling):

          .. code-block:: python

              partition = ...  # Partition object for the new NIC

              adapter_name = 'OSA #1'  # name of adapter with backing port
              adapter_port_index = 0   # port index of backing port

              adapter = partition.manager.cpc.adapters.find(name=adapter_name)

              vswitches = partition.manager.cpc.virtual_switches.findall(
                  **{'backing-adapter-uri': adapter.uri})

              vswitch = None
              for vs in vswitches:
                  if vs.get_property('port') == adapter_port_index:
                      vswitch = vs
                      break

              properties['virtual-switch-uri'] = vswitch.uri

        * For RoCE adapters, the "network-adapter-port-uri" property is used to
          specify the URI of the backing adapter port, directly.

          The value for the "network-adapter-port-uri" property can be
          determined from a given adapter name and port index as shown in the
          following example code (omitting any error handling):

          .. code-block:: python

              partition = ...  # Partition object for the new NIC

              adapter_name = 'ROCE #1'  # name of adapter with backing port
              adapter_port_index = 0   # port index of backing port

              adapter = partition.manager.cpc.adapters.find(name=adapter_name)

              port = adapter.ports.find(index=adapter_port_index)

              properties['network-adapter-port-uri'] = port.uri

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to this Partition.
        * Object-access permission to the backing Adapter for the new NIC.
