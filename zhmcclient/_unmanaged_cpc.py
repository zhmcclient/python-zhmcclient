A :term:`CPC` (Central Processor Complex) is a physical IBM Z or LinuxONE
computer.

A particular HMC can manage multiple CPCs and can discover other CPCs that
are not managed by that HMC. Such other CPCs are called "unmanaged CPCs" and
they may or may not be managed by another HMC.

This section describes the interface for *unmanaged* CPCs using resource class
:class:`~zhmcclient.UnmanagedCpc` and the corresponding manager class
:class:`~zhmcclient.UnmanagedCpcManager`.
