"""
A :term:`CPC` (Central Processor Complex) is a physical IBM Z or LinuxONE
computer.

A particular HMC can manage multiple CPCs and can discover other CPCs that
are not managed by that HMC. Such other CPCs are called "unmanaged CPCs" and
they may or may not be managed by another HMC.

This section describes the interface for *managed* CPCs using resource class
:class:`~zhmcclient.Cpc` and the corresponding manager class
:class:`~zhmcclient.CpcManager`.

The HMC can manage a range of old and new CPC generations. Some older CPC
generations are not capable of supporting the HMC Web Services API; these older
CPCs can be managed using the GUI of the HMC, but not through its Web Services
API. Therefore, such older CPCs will not be exposed at the HMC Web Services
API, and thus will not show up in the API of this Python package.

TODO: List earliest CPC generation that supports the HMC Web Services API.

A CPC can be in any of the following three modes:

- DPM mode: Dynamic Partition Manager is enabled for the CPC.
- Classic mode: The CPC does not have Dynamic Partition Manager enabled,
  and is not member of an ensemble.
- Ensemble mode: The CPC is member of an ensemble. This Python client
  does not support the functionality that is specific to ensemble mode.

The functionality supported at the HMC API and thus also for users of this
Python client, depends on the mode in which the CPC currently is. If a
particular functionality is available only in a specific mode, that is
indicated in the description of the functionality.

        """
        Return a list of crypto domains that are free for usage on a list of
        crypto adapters in this CPC.

        A crypto domain is considered free for usage if it is not assigned to
        any defined partition of this CPC in access mode 'control-usage' on any
        of the specified crypto adapters.

        For this test, all currently defined partitions of this CPC are
        checked, regardless of whether or not they are active. This ensures
        that a crypto domain that is found to be free for usage can be assigned
        to a partition for 'control-usage' access to the specified crypto
        adapters, without causing a crypto domain conflict when activating that
        partition.

        Note that a similar notion of free domains does not exist for access
        mode 'control', because a crypto domain on a crypto adapter can be
        in control access by multiple active partitions.

        This method requires the CPC to be in DPM mode.

        **Example:**

            .. code-block:: text

                           crypto domains
               adapters     0   1   2   3

                          +---+---+---+---+
                 c2       |b,c|B,c| B | C |
                          +---+---+---+---+

            In this example, the CPC has two crypto adapters c1 and c2. For
            simplicity of the example, we assume these crypto adapters support
            only 4 crypto domains.

            Partition A uses only adapter c1 and has domain 0 in
            'control-usage' access (indicated by an upper case letter 'A' in
            the corresponding cell) and has domain 1 in 'control' access
            (indicated by a lower case letter 'a' in the corresponding cell).

            Partition B uses only adapter c2 and has domain 0 in 'control'
            access and domains 1 and 2 in 'control-usage' access.

            Partition C uses both adapters, and has domains 0 and 1 in
            'control' access and domain 3 in 'control-usage' access.

            The domains free for usage in this example are shown in the
            following table, for each combination of crypto adapters to be
            investigated:

            ===============  ======================
            crypto_adapters  domains free for usage
            ===============  ======================
            c1               1, 2
            c2               0
            c1, c2           (empty list)
            ===============  ======================

        **Experimental:** This method has been added in v0.14.0 and is
        currently considered experimental. Its interface may change
        incompatibly. Once the interface remains stable, this experimental
        marker will be removed.

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to this CPC.
        * Object-access permission to all of its Partitions.
        * Object-access permission to all of its crypto Adapters.

            The crypto :term:`Adapters <Adapter>` to be investigated.

        Returns:

            A DPM configuration, represented as a dictionary with the
            fields described for the "Import DPM Configuration" operation
            in the :term:`HMC API` book.

            Resource URIs are represented as URI strings in the fields of
            the DPM configuration, as described for the request body fields
            of the HMC operation.

            Empty fields are omitted from the returned configuration. This
            allows using newer versions of zhmcclient that may have added
            support for a feature of a new generation of Z systems with
            older generations of Z systems that did not yet have the feature.

            The optional "preserve-uris", "preserve-wwpns", and
            "adapter-mapping" fields will not be in the returned dictionary,
            so their defaults will be used when importing this DPM configuration
            unchanged to a CPC.

            The returned DPM configuration object can be passed to
            :meth:`~zhmcclient.Cpc.import_dpm_configuration` either unchanged,
            or after changing it, e.g. by adding the optional "preserve-uris",
            "preserve-wwpns", or "adapter-mapping" fields.
