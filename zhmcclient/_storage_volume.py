"""
A :class:`~zhmcclient.StorageVolume` object represents an FCP or FICON (ECKD)
:term:`storage volume` that is defined in a :term:`storage group`.

Storage volume objects can be created, but what is created is the definition
of a storage volume in the HMC and CPC. This does not include the act of
actually allocating the volume on a storage subsystem. That is performed by a
storage administrator who :term:`fulfills <fulfillment>` the volumes.

In order to represent that, storage volume objects have a fulfillment state
that is available in their 'fulfillment-state' property.

When a storage group is attached to a :term:`partition`, the group's
storage volumes are attached to the partition and any :term:`virtual storage
resource` objects are instantiated.

Storage volumes are contained in :term:`storage groups <storage group>`.

You can create as many storage volumes as you want in a storage group.

Storage groups and storage volumes only can be defined in CPCs that are in
DPM mode and that have the "dpm-storage-management" feature enabled.

            Note that for storage volumes, the HMC does auto-generate a value
            for the "name" property, but that auto-generated name is not unique

            If `None` or empty, no email will be sent.

          email_cc_addresses (:term:`iterable` of :term:`string`): Email
            addresses of one or more storage administrator to be copied
            on the notification email.
            If `None` or empty, nobody will be copied on the email.
            Must be `None` or empty if `email_to_addresses` is `None` or empty.

          email_insert (:term:`string`): Additional text to be inserted in the
            notification email.
            The text can include HTML formatting tags.

        TODO: Add ControlUnit objects etc for FICON support.

        Indicate completion of :term:`fulfillment` for this ECKD (=FICON)
        storage volume and provide identifying information (control unit
        and unit address) about the actual storage volume on the storage
        subsystem.

        Manually indicating fulfillment is required for all ECKD volumes,
        because they are not auto-discovered by the CPC.

        This method performs the "Fulfill FICON Storage Volume" HMC operation.

        Upon successful completion of this operation, the "fulfillment-state"
        property of this storage volume object will have been set to
        "complete". That is necessary for the CPC to be able to address and
        connect to the volume.

        If the "fulfillment-state" properties of all storage volumes in the
        owning storage group are "complete", the owning storage group's
        "fulfillment-state" property will also be set to "complete".

        Parameters:

          control_unit (:class:`~zhmcclient.ControlUnit`):
            Logical control unit (LCU) in which the backing ECKD volume is
            defined.

          unit_address (:term:`string`):
            Unit address of the backing ECKD volume within its logical control
            unit,
            as a hexadecimal number of up to 2 characters in any lexical case.

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to the storage group owning this storage
          volume.
        * Task permission to the "Configure Storage - Storage Administrator"
          task.

        Indicate completion of :term:`fulfillment` for this FCP storage volume
        and provide identifying information (WWPN and LUN) about the actual
        storage volume on the storage subsystem.

        Manually indicating fulfillment is required for storage volumes that
        will be used as boot devices for a partition. The specified host
        port will be used to access the storage volume during boot of the
        partition.

        Because the CPC discovers storage volumes automatically, the
        fulfillment of non-boot volumes does not need to be manually indicated
        using this function (it may be indicated though before the CPC
        discovers a working communications path to the volume, but the role
        of the specified host port is not clear in this case).

        This method performs the "Fulfill FCP Storage Volume" HMC operation.

        Upon successful completion of this operation, the "fulfillment-state"

        "fulfillment-state" property will also be set to "complete".

        Parameters:

          wwpn (:term:`string`):
            World wide port name (WWPN) of the FCP storage subsystem containing
            the storage volume,
            as a hexadecimal number of up to 16 characters in any lexical case.

          lun (:term:`string`):

            storage subsystem,
            as a hexadecimal number of up to 16 characters in any lexical case.

          host_port (:class:`~zhmcclient.Port`):
            Storage port on the CPC that will be used to boot from.
