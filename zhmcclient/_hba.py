A :term:`HBA` (Host Bus Adapter) is a logical entity that provides a
:term:`Partition` with access to external storage area networks (SANs) through
an :term:`FCP Adapter`. More specifically, an HBA connects a Partition with an
:term:`Adapter Port` on an FCP Adapter.

HBA resources are contained in Partition resources.

HBA resources only exist in :term:`CPCs <CPC>` that are in DPM mode and when
the "dpm-storage-management" feature is not enabled. See section
:ref:`Storage Groups` for details. When the "dpm-storage-management" feature is
enabled, :term:`virtual HBAs <HBA>` are represented as
:term:`Virtual Storage Resource` resources.
