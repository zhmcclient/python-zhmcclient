        This method performs the 'Get Inventory' HMC operation.

        If resources cannot be fully inventoried, the returned list contains
        items describing the errors. They can be identified by their 'class'
        property having a value of 'inventory-error'. Note that the presence
        of such error items does not cause any exceptions to be raised.

        Parameters:

          resources (:term:`iterable` of :term:`string`):
            Resource classes and/or resource classifiers specifying the types
            of resources that should be included in the result. For valid
            values, see the 'Get Inventory' operation in the :term:`HMC API`
            book.

            Element resources of the specified resource types are automatically
            included as children (for example, requesting 'partition' includes
            all of its 'hba', 'nic' and 'virtual-function' element resources).

            Must not be `None`.

        Returns:

            classes and resource classifiers. Each list item is a dictionary
