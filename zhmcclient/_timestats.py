The :class:`~zhmcclient.TimeStatsKeeper` class allows measuring the elapsed
time of accordingly instrumented code and keeps a statistics of these times.

The :class:`~zhmcclient.Session` class uses this class for keeping
statistics about the time to issue HTTP requests against the HMC API (see its
:attr:`~zhmcclient.Session.time_stats_keeper` property).

The :class:`~zhmcclient.TimeStats` class is a helper class that contains the
actual measurement data for all invocations of a particular HTTP request. Its
objects are under control of the :class:`~zhmcclient.TimeStatsKeeper` class.

Example::

    import zhmcclient

    session = zhmcclient.Session(hmc, userid, password)
    session.time_stats_keeper.enable()

    # Some operations that are being measured
    client = zhmcclient.Client(session)
    cpcs = client.cpcs.list()

    print(session.time_stats_keeper)
