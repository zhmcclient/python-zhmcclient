"""
An :term:`Adapter` is a physical adapter card (e.g. OSA-Express adapter,
Crypto adapter) or a logical adapter (e.g. HiperSockets switch).

Adapter resources are contained in :term:`CPC` resources.

Adapters only exist in CPCs that are in DPM mode.

There are four types of Adapters:

1. Network Adapters:
   Network adapters enable communication through different networking
   transport protocols. These network adapters are OSA-Express,
   HiperSockets and RoCE-Express.
   DPM automatically discovers OSA-Express and RoCE-Express adapters
   because they are physical cards that are installed on the CPC.
   In contrast, HiperSockets are logical adapters and must be
   created and configured by an administrator using the 'Create Hipersocket'
   operation (see create_hipersocket()).
   Network Interface Cards (NICs) provide a partition with access to networks.
   Each NIC represents a unique connection between the partition
   and a specific network adapter.

2. Storage Adapters:
   Fibre Channel connections provide high-speed connections between CPCs
   and storage devices.
   DPM automatically discovers any storage adapters installed on the CPC.
   Host bus adapters (HBAs) provide a partition with access to external
   storage area networks (SANs) and devices that are connected to a CPC.
   Each HBA represents a unique connection between the partition
   and a specific storage adapter.

3. Accelerator Adapters:
   Accelerator adapters provide specialized functions to
   improve performance or use of computer resource like the IBM System z
   Enterprise Data Compression (zEDC) feature.
   DPM automatically discovers accelerators that are installed on the CPC.
   An accelerator virtual function provides a partition with access
   to zEDC features that are installed on a CPC.
   Each virtual function represents a unique connection between
   the partition and a physical feature card.

4. Crypto Adapters:
   Crypto adapters provide cryptographic processing functions.
   DPM automatically discovers cryptographic features that are installed
   on the CPC.

        Any resource property may be specified in a filter argument. For

        The listing of resources is handled in an optimized way:

        * If this manager is enabled for :ref:`auto-updating`, a locally
          maintained resource list is used (which is automatically updated via
          inventory notifications from the HMC) and the provided filter
          arguments are applied.

        * Otherwise, if the filter arguments specify the resource name as a
          single filter argument with a straight match string (i.e. without
          regular expressions), an optimized lookup is performed based on a
          locally maintained name-URI cache.

        * Otherwise, the HMC List operation is performed with the subset of the
          provided filter arguments that can be handled on the HMC side and the
          remaining filter arguments are applied on the client side on the list
          result.

        Authorization requirements:

        * Object-access permission to this CPC.
        * Object-access permission to any Adapter to be included in the result.

          full_properties (bool):
            Controls whether the full set of resource properties should be
            retrieved, vs. only the short set as returned by the list

          filter_args (dict):
            Filter arguments that narrow the list of returned resources to
            those that match the specified filter arguments. For details, see
            :ref:`Filtering`.

            `None` causes no filtering to happen, i.e. all resources are
            returned.

        Reconfigures an adapter from one type to another, or to ungonfigured.
        Currently, only storage adapters can be reconfigured, and their adapter
        type is the supported storage protocol (FCP vs. FICON).

        Storage adapter instances (i.e. :class:`~zhmcclient.Adapter` objects)
        represent daughter cards on a physical storage card. Current storage
        cards require both daughter cards to be configured to the same
        protocol, so changing the type of the targeted adapter will also change
        the type of the adapter instance that represents the other daughter
        card on the same physical card. Zhmcclient users that need to determine
        the related adapter instance can do so by finding the storage adapter
        with a matching first 9 characters (card ID and slot ID) of their
        `card-location` property values.

        The targeted adapter and its related adapter on the same storage card
        must not already have the desired adapter type, they must not be
        attached to any partition, and they must not have an adapter status
        of 'exceptions'.
