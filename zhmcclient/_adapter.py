An :term:`Adapter` is a physical adapter card (e.g. OSA-Express adapter,
Crypto adapter) or a logical adapter (e.g. HiperSockets switch).

Adapter resources are contained in :term:`CPC` resources.

Adapters only exist in CPCs that are in DPM mode.

There are four types of Adapters:

1. Network Adapters:
   Network adapters enable communication through different networking
   transport protocols. These network adapters are OSA-Express,
   HiperSockets and RoCE-Express.
   DPM automatically discovers OSA-Express and RoCE-Express adapters
   because they are physical cards that are installed on the CPC.
   In contrast, HiperSockets are logical adapters and must be
   created and configured by an administrator using the 'Create Hipersocket'
   operation (see create_hipersocket()).
   Network Interface Cards (NICs) provide a partition with access to networks.
   Each NIC represents a unique connection between the partition
   and a specific network adapter.

2. Storage Adapters:
   Fibre Channel connections provide high-speed connections between CPCs
   and storage devices.
   DPM automatically discovers any storage adapters installed on the CPC.
   Host bus adapters (HBAs) provide a partition with access to external
   storage area networks (SANs) and devices that are connected to a CPC.
   Each HBA represents a unique connection between the partition
   and a specific storage adapter.

3. Accelerator Adapters:
   Accelerator adapters provide specialized functions to
   improve performance or use of computer resource like the IBM System z
   Enterprise Data Compression (zEDC) feature.
   DPM automatically discovers accelerators that are installed on the CPC.
   An accelerator virtual function provides a partition with access
   to zEDC features that are installed on a CPC.
   Each virtual function represents a unique connection between
   the partition and a physical feature card.

4. Crypto Adapters:
   Crypto adapters provide cryptographic processing functions.
   DPM automatically discovers cryptographic features that are installed
   on the CPC.
