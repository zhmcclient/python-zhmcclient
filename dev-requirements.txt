# Jupyter Notebook (no imports, invoked via jupyter script):
# Note: The packages for Jupyter Notebook are prone to causing endless pip backtracking when
#       installed with minimum versions. This was addressed by pinning the package versions
#       to a maximum in order to reduce the search space for pip.
# Note: nbconvert 7.0.0 started using importlib-metadata and requires importlib-metadata>=3.6
#       which conflicts with flake8 (which still uses the deprecated interfaces importlib-metadata
#       removed). Therefore, we cannot currently use the latest versions of Jupyter Notebook
#       packages.
# Note: notebook 6.5.1 starts using nbclassic which seems to introduce some challenges for pip
#       dependency resolution, so for now we pin notebook to <6.5.
