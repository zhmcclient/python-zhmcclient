.. _`Command line interface`:

Command line interface
======================

This package provides a command line interface (CLI) that utilizes the API of
the zhmcclient package in order to support shell scripting or simply manual
command use in a terminal session.


.. _`Modes of operation`:

Modes of operation
------------------

The zhmc CLI supports two modes of operation:

* `Interactive mode`_: Invoking an interactive zhmc shell for typing zhmc
  sub-commands.
* `Command mode`_: Using it as a standalone non-interactive command.


.. _`Interactive mode`:

Interactive mode
----------------

In interactive mode, an interactive shell environment is brought up that allows
typing zhmc commands, internal commands (for operating the zhmc shell), and
external commands (that are executed in the standard shell for the user).

This zhmc shell is started when the ``zhmc`` command is invoked without
specifying any (sub-)commands:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc [GENERAL-OPTIONS]
    > _

Alternatively, the zhmc shell can also be started by specifying the ``repl``
(sub-)command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc [GENERAL-OPTIONS] repl
    > _

The zhmc shell uses the ``>`` prompt, and the cursor is shown in the examples
above as an underscore ``_``.

General options may be specified on the ``zhmc`` command, and they serve as
defaults for the zhmc commands that can be typed in the zhmc shell.

The zhmc commands that can be typed in the zhmc shell are simply the command
line arguments that would follow the ``zhmc`` command when used in
`command mode`_:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser
    Enter password: <password>
    > cpc list
    . . . <list of CPCs managed by this HMC>
    > partition list JLSE1
    . . . <list of partitions in CPC JLSE1>
    > :q

For example, the zhmc shell command ``cpc list`` in the example above has the
same effect as the standalone command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser cpc list
    Enter password: <password>
    . . . <list of CPCs managed by this HMC>

However, the zhmc shell will prompt for a password only once during its
invocation, while the standalone command will prompt for a password every time.
See also `Environment variables and avoiding password prompts`_.

In interactive mode, there is only one set of general options. Therefore,
any general options specified on an interactively typed subcommand modify
that one set of options, and they are available as defaults to the next
subcommand. Changing host, userid or password on a subcommand resets the
session with the HMC and drives a new session creation.

The internal commands ``:?``, ``:h``, or ``:help`` display general help
information for external and internal commands:

.. code-block:: text

    > :help
    REPL help:

      External Commands:
        prefix external commands with "!"

      Internal Commands:
        prefix internal commands with ":"
        :?, :h, :help     displays general help information
        :exit, :q, :quit  exits the repl

In this help text, "REPL" stands for "Read-Execute-Print-Loop" which is a
term that denotes the approach used in the zhmc shell (or in any shell, for
that matter).

In addition to using one of the internal shell commands shown in the help text
above, you can also exit the zhmc shell by typing `Ctrl-D`.

Typing ``--help`` in the zhmc shell displays general help information for the
zhmc commands, which includes global options and a list of the supported
commands:

.. code-block:: text

    > --help

The usage line in this help text show the standalone command use. Within the
zhmc shell, the ``zhmc`` word is ommitted and the remainder is typed in.

Typing ``COMMAND --help`` in the zhmc shell displays help information for the
specified zhmc command, for example:

.. code-block:: text

    > cpc --help
    Usage: zhmc  cpc [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

      Command group for managing CPCs.

    Options:
      --help  Show this message and exit.

    Commands:
      list  List the CPCs.
      show  Show details of a CPC.

The zhmc shell supports popup help text while typing, where the valid choices
are shown based upon what was typed so far, and where an item from the popup
list can be picked with <TAB> or with the cursor keys. In the following
examples, an underscore ``_`` is shown as the cursor:

.. code-block:: text

    > --_
        --host            Hostname or IP address of the HMC (Default: ZHMC_HOST environment variable).
        --userid          Username for the HMC (Default: ZHMC_USERID environment variable).
        --password        Password for the HMC (Default: ZHMC_PASSWORD environment variable).
        --output-format   Output format (Default: table).
        --transpose       Transpose the output table for metrics.
        --error-format    Error message format (Default: msg).

        --log             Set a component to a log level (COMP: [api|hmc|console|all], LEVEL: [error|warning|info|debug], Default: all=warning).
        --log-dest        Log destination for this command (Default: stderr).
        --syslog-facility Syslog facility when logging to the syslog (Default: user).
        --version         Show the version of this command and exit.

    > c_
       cpc    Command group for managing CPCs.

The zhmc shell supports history (within one invocation of the shell, not
persisted across zhmc shell invocations).


.. _`Command mode`:

Command mode
------------

In command mode, the ``zhmc`` command performs its task and terminates, like any
other standalone non-interactive command.

This mode is used when the ``zhmc`` command is invoked with a (sub-)command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc [GENERAL-OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS...] [COMMAND-OPTIONS]

Examples:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser cpc list
    Enter password: <password>
    . . . <list of CPCs managed by this HMC>

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com info
    Enter password: <password>
    . . . <information about this HMC>

In command mode, bash tab completion is also supported, but must be enabled
first as follows (in a bash shell):

.. code-block:: text

    $ eval "$(_ZHMC_COMPLETE=source zhmc)"

Bash tab completion for zhmc is used like any other bash tab completion:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc --<TAB><TAB>
    ... <shows the global options to select from>

    $ zhmc <TAB><TAB>
    ... <shows the commands to select from>

    $ zhmc cpc <TAB><TAB>
    ... <shows the cpc sub-commands to select from>


.. _`Environment variables and avoiding password prompts`:

Environment variables and avoiding password prompts
---------------------------------------------------

The zhmc CLI has command line options for specifying the HMC host, userid and
password to be used.

If the HMC operations performed by a particular zhmc command require a
password, and the password is not specified otherwise, the password is prompted
for (in both modes of operation):

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser cpc list
    Enter password: <password>
    . . . <list of CPCs managed by this HMC>

If the HMC operations performed by a particular zhmc command do not require a
password, no password is prompted for:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com info
    . . . <information about this HMC>

For script integration, it is important to have a way to avoid the interactive
password prompt, and still not being forced to specify the password on the
command line. This can be done in either of two ways:

* by storing the session-id string returned by the HMC when logging on, in an
  environment variable.

  The ``zhmc`` command supports a ``session create`` (sub-)command that outputs
  the (bash) shell commands to set all needed environment variables:

  .. code-block:: text

      $ zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser session create
      Enter password: <password>
      export ZHMC_HOST=zhmc.example.com
      export ZHMC_USERID=hmcuser
      export ZHMC_SESSION_ID=<session-id>

  This ability can be used to set those environment variables and thus to
  persist the session-id in the shell environment, from where it will be used
  in any subsequent zhmc commands:

  .. code-block:: text

      $ eval $(zhmc -h zhmc.example.com -u hmcuser session create)
      Enter password: <password>

      $ env |grep ZHMC
      ZHMC_HOST=zhmc.example.com
      ZHMC_USERID=hmcuser
      ZHMC_SESSION_ID=<session-id>

      $ zhmc cpc list
      . . . <list of CPCs managed by this HMC>

  As you can see from this example, the password is only prompted for when
  creating the session, and the session-id stored in the shell environment is
  utilized in the ``zhmc cpc list`` command, avoiding another password prompt.

  Using the session-id from the environment is also a performance improvement,
  because it avoids the HMC Logon operation that otherwise would take place.

* by storing the HMC password in the ZHMC_PASSWORD environment variable.

The ZHMC_HOST, ZHMC_USERID, and ZHMC_PASSWORD environment variables act as
defaults for the corresponding command line options.

.. _`CLI commands`:

CLI commands
------------

For a description of the commands supported by the zhmc CLI, consult its
help system. For example:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc --help
    . . . <general help, listing the general options and possible commands>

    $ zhmc cpc --help
    . . . <help for cpc command, listing its arguments and command-specific options>

Note that the help text for any zhmc (sub-)commands (such as ``cpc``) will
not show the general options again. This is caused by flaws in the tooling
environment used for the zhmc CLI.
The general options (listed by ``zhmc --help``) can still be specified together
with (sub-)commands even though they are not listed in their help text, but
they must be specified before the (sub-)command, and any command-specific
options (listed by ``zhmc COMMAND --help``) must be specified after the
(sub-)command, like shown here:

.. code-block:: text

      $ zhmc [GENERAL-OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS...] [COMMAND-OPTIONS]


.. _`Output formats`:

Output formats
--------------

The zhmc CLI supports various output formats for the results. The output format
can be selected with the ``-o`` or ``--output-format`` option. The following
output formats are supported:

* ``-o table``: Tables with a single-line border. This is the default:

  .. code-block:: text

      +----------+------------------+
      | name     | status           |
      |----------+------------------|
      | P0000P27 | operating        |
      | P0000P28 | service-required |
      | P0ZGMR12 | no-power         |
      +----------+------------------+

* ``-o psql``: Same as 'table'.

* ``-o simple``: Tables with a line between header row and data rows, but
  otherwise without borders:

  .. code-block:: text

      name      status
      --------  ----------------
      P0000P27  operating
      P0000P28  service-required
      P0ZGMR12  no-power

* ``-o plain``: Tables without borders:

  .. code-block:: text

      name      status
      P0000P27  operating
      P0000P28  service-required
      P0ZGMR12  no-power

* ``-o rst``: Simple tables in `reStructuredText`_ markup:

  .. code-block:: text

      ========  ================
      name      status
      ========  ================
      P0000P27  operating
      P0000P28  service-required
      P0ZGMR12  no-power
      ========  ================

* ``-o mediawiki``: Tables in `Mediawiki`_ markup:

  .. Note: The 'moin' language in the following code-block is used because
  .. Pygments does not specifically support the MediaWiki language.

  .. code-block:: moin

      {| class="wikitable" style="text-align: left;"
      |+ <!-- caption -->
      |-
      ! name     !! status
      |-
      | P0000P27 || operating
      |-
      | P0000P28 || service-required
      |-
      | P0ZGMR12 || no-power
      |}

* ``-o html``: Tables in `HTML`_ markup:

  .. code-block:: html

      <table>
      <thead>
      <tr><th>name    </th><th>status          </th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
      <tr><td>P0000P27</td><td>operating       </td></tr>
      <tr><td>P0000P28</td><td>service-required</td></tr>
      <tr><td>P0ZGMR12</td><td>no-power        </td></tr>
      </tbody>
      </table>

* ``-o latex``: Tables in `LaTeX`_ markup:

  .. code-block:: latex

      \begin{tabular}{ll}
      \hline
       name     & status           \\
      \hline
       P0000P27 & operating        \\
       P0000P28 & service-required \\
       P0ZGMR12 & no-power         \\
      \hline
      \end{tabular}

* ``-o json``: `JSON`_ objects:

  .. code-block:: json

      [{"name": "P0000P28", "status": "service-required"},
       {"name": "P0ZGMR12", "status": "no-power"},
       {"name": "P0000P27", "status": "operating"}]

.. _`Error message formats`:

Error message formats
---------------------

In order to be able to programmatically process errors, the zhmc CLI supports
multiple formats for its error messages.

Error messages are always printed to stderr, and the zhmc command always ends
with a non-zero return code in case of errors.

The format of error messages can be selected with the ``-e`` or
``--error-format`` option. The following error message formats are supported:

* ``-e msg``: Human-readable message. This is the default. This format should
  not be parsed by scripts, because it may change. Example:

  .. code-block:: text

      Error: ConnectTimeout: Connection to 9.152.150.86 timed out. (connect timeout=30)

* ``-e def``: Definition-style (e.g. "name: value"). In this format, the
  instance variables of the exception object causing the error are shown as
  variables. This format is meant for parsing by scripts that invoke the zhmc
  CLI and that need to handle specific error situations.

  The format of each error message is:

  .. code-block:: text

      Error: {str-def-result}

  where ``{str-def-result}`` is the return value of the
  :meth:`~zhmcclient.Error.str_def` method of the exception causing the error
  message (or rather its implementations in derived exception classes).
  Example:

  .. code-block:: text

      Error: classname='ConnectTimeout'; connect_timeout=30; connect_retries=3; message=u'Connection to 9.152.150.86 timed out. (connect timeout=30)';

  The variables for any particular exception is documented in the ``str_def()``
  method of the exception class, in this case
  :meth:`zhmcclient.ConnectTimeout.str_def`:

  .. code-block:: text

      classname={}; connect_timeout={}; connect_retries={}; message={};

  The ``{}`` sequences contain the Python representations for the values
  (using ``repr()``).

  With the exception of the initial "Error:", this is in fact Python syntax
  for setting variables. Therefore, it is best to use Python for parsing it
  from within a shell script that invokes the zhmc CLI, for example as follows:

  .. code-block:: bash

      err_file=$(mktemp)
      cpc_list=$(zhmc -o json -e def cpc list 2>$err_file)
      rc=$?
      err=$(tail -n 1 <$err_file | sed -e 's/^Error: //')
      rm $err_file
      if [[ $rc != 0 ]]; then
          if [[ "$err" =~ "classname='ConnectTimeout';" ]]; then
              ct=$(python -c "$err print(connect_timeout)")
              echo "connect-timeout: $ct"
          fi
          msg=$(python -c "$err print(message)")
          echo "message: $msg"
          exit 1
      fi
      echo "$cpc_list"


.. _`CLI logging`:

CLI logging
-----------

The zhmc CLI supports logging to the standard error stream, and to the
system log.

By default, the zhmc CLI logs to the standard error stream. This can be changed
via the global option ``--log-dest`` which specifies the log destination:

* ``stderr`` - Standard error stream of the zhmc command.
* ``syslog`` - System log of the local system.
* ``none`` - No logging.

The global option ``--log`` allows specifying one or more combinations of log
component and log level. For example, the command:

.. code-block:: text

    $ zhmc --log hmc=debug,api=info ...

sets log level ``debug`` for the ``hmc`` component, and log level ``info`` for
the ``api`` component.

Valid log levels are: ``error``, ``warning``, ``info``, ``debug``. In case of
logging to the system log, this will also set the syslog priority accordingly.

Valid log components are:

* ``api`` - Enable the ``zhmcclient.api`` Python logger, which logs any API
  calls into the zhmcclient library that are made from the zhmc CLI.
* ``hmc`` - Enable the ``zhmcclient.hmc`` Python logger, which logs the
  interactions with the HMC.
* ``console`` - Enable the ``zhmccli.console`` Python logger, which logs the
  interactions with the console of the operating system running in a partition
  or LPAR.
* ``all`` - Enable the root Python logger, which logs anything that is
  propagated up to it. In case of the zhmc CLI, this will mostly be the
  ``requests`` package, plus the ``api`` and ``hmc`` components.

Logging to the system log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When specifying the ``syslog`` log destination, the enabled Python loggers
log to the system log of the local system.

In order to see something in the system log, one has to understand how the
log records are marked in terms of `facility` and `priority` and the
corresponding matching of these markers in the syslog demon, and the
mechanism that is used to write a record to the syslog needs to be enabled.

The write mechanism used by the zhmc CLI depends on the platform, as follows:

* On Linux: Via a Unix socket to ``/dev/log``
* On OS-X: Via a Unix socket to ``/var/run/syslog``
* On Windows: Via a UDP socket to ``localhost`` port 514

The respective mechanism must be enabled on the platform for logging to work.
If the required mechanism is not enabled on a system, the log record will
simply be dropped silently.

The `facility` used for each log record can be specified with the global option
``--syslog-facility``, to be one of: ``user`` (default), ``local<N>`` with
N=[0..7].

This facility marker can be used in the configuration of the syslog demon on
the local system to direct log records into different files.

For example, on RHEL 7 and CentOS 7, the syslog demon's config file is
``/etc/rsyslog.conf`` and may contain this:

.. code-block:: text

    #### RULES ####
    *.info;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages

The first string is a semicolon-separated list of ``<facility>.<priority>``
markers, where ``*`` can be used for wildcarding. The first list item
``*.info`` means that any facility with priority ``info`` or higher will match
this line and will thus go into the ``/var/log/messages`` file.

Because the zhmc CLI uses the ``debug`` log level, one can see that only
if its corresponding priority is enabled in the syslog configuration:

.. code-block:: text

    #### RULES ####
    *.debug;mail.none;authpriv.none;cron.none                /var/log/messages
