**Enhancements:**

* Added a script named ``tools/cpcinfo`` that displays information about CPCs.

  allows specifying a default value in case the property does not exist.

* Added :meth:`~zhmcclient.Cpc.get_wwpns` which performs HMC operation
  'Export WWPN List'.

* Added :meth:`~zhmcclient.Hba.reassign_port` which performs HMC operation
  'Reassign Storage Adapter Port'.

* Clarifications in the :ref:`Resource model` section.

* Optimized :attr:`~zhmcclient.Cpc.dpm_enabled` property to use
  'List Partitions' and  'List Logical Partitions' operations, in order to
