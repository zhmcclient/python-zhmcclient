    "* [`zhmcclient.Error`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.Error) - exception base class. It is an abstract base class, meaning that this exception is not raised; but it is the base class for all zhmcclient-defined  exception classes and can therefore be used to catch all zhmcclient-specific exceptions:\n",
    "  * [`zhmcclient.ConnectionError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ConnectionError) - indicates a problem with the connection to the HMC, at the transport level or below. Is used both for being raised, and as a base class for more specific exceptions:\n",
    "    * [`zhmcclient.ConnectTimeout`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ConnectTimeout) - indicates that a connection to the HMC timed out after exhausting the connect retries.\n",
    "    * [`zhmcclient.RetriesExceeded`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.RetriesExceeded) - indicates that the maximum number of retries for connecting to the HMC, sending HTTP requests or reading HTTP responses was exceeded, for reasons other than connect timeouts.\n",
    "    * [`zhmcclient.ReadTimeout`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ConnectTimeout) - indicates that reading an HTTP response from the HMC timed out after exhausting the read retries.\n",
    "  * [`zhmcclient.AuthError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.AuthError) - indicates an authentication error with the HMC, either at the TLS/SSL handshake level (e.g. with CA certificates), or at the HTTP level. Is used both for being raised, and as a base class for more specific exceptions:\n",
    "    * [`zhmcclient.ClientAuthError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ClientAuthError) - indicates an authentication related problem detected on the client side.\n",
    "    * [`zhmcclient.ServerAuthError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ServerAuthError) - indicates an authentication error with the HMC.\n",

    "  * [`zhmcclient.OperationTimeout`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.OperationTimeout) - indicates that the waiting for completion of an asynchronous HMC operation has timed out.\n",
    "  * [`zhmcclient.StatusTimeout`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.StatusTimeout) - indicates that the waiting for reaching a desired LPAR or Partition status has timed out.\n",
    "  * [`zhmcclient.ParseError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.ParseError) - indicates a parsing error while processing a response from the HMC.\n",
    "  * [`zhmcclient.VersionError`](https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/general.html#zhmcclient.VersionError) - indicates that there is a version mismatch between the HMC API versions supported by the client and by the HMC.\n",
