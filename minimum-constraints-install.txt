# Pip constraints file for install dependencies.
#
# This file specifies constraints that match the minimum versions specified in
# the requirement files for install. They are used for example when setting up
# test environments with the minimum versions of any dependent packages.


# Base dependencies

# pip 10.0.0 introduced the --exclude-editable option.
# pip 18.0 is needed on pypy3 (py36) to support constraints like cffi!=1.11.3,>=1.8.
# Pip 20.2 introduced a new resolver whose backtracking had issues that were resolved only in 21.2.2.
# pip>=21.0 is needed for the cryptography package on Windows on GitHub Actions.
