# HMC inventory file with mocked HMCs for end2end tests run by GitHub Actions
#
# This file defines only mocked HMCs (using the zhmcclient mock
# support) for the purpose of end2end tests against these HMCs.
# The file must have the format defined in
# zhmcclient/testutils/hmc_inventory_file.py of the python-zhmcclient project.
#
# HMC inventory files conform to the format of HMC inventory files in YAML
# format and define specific additional variables for HMCs.
#
# Brief description of the HMC inventory file format:
#
#   all:  # the top-level HMC group
#     hosts:
#       <hmc_name>:  # DNS hostname, IP address, or nickname of HMC
#         description: <string>
#         contact: <string>
#         access_via: <string>
#         ansible_host: <host>  # if real HMC and nickname is used
#         mock_file: <path_name>  # if mocked HMC
#         cpcs:
#           <cpc_name>:
#             <prop_name>: <prop_value>
#         <var_name>: <var_value>  # additional variables for HMC
#     vars:
#       <var_name>: <var_value>  # additional variables for all HMCs in group
#     children:
#       <group_name>:  # a child HMC group
#         hosts: ...  # variables are inherited from parent group
#         vars: ...
#         children: ...
