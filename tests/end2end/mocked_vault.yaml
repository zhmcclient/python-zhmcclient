# HMC vault file with mocked HMCs for end2end tests run by GitHub Actions
#
# This file defines the credentials for mocked HMCs for use by the
# zhmcclient.testutils module of the python-zhmcclient project.
#
# The file must have the format defined in
# zhmcclient/testutils/hmc_vault_file.py of the python-zhmcclient project.
#
# HMC vault files conform to the format of Ansible vault files in YAML
# format and define specific variables for HMC authentication.
#
# Brief description of the file format:

#     <hmc_name>:  # DNS hostname, IP address, or nickname of HMC
#       userid: <userid>
#       password: <password>
#       verify: <verify>
#       ca_certs: <ca_certs>
#   <var_name>: <var_value>  # allowed but ignored
#
