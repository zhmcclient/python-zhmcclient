# HMC inventory file for zhmcclient.testutils
#
# This file defines real HMCs and mocked HMCs (using the zhmcclient mock
# support) for use by the zhmcclient.testutils module of the python-zhmcclient
# project.
#
# The file must have the format defined in
# zhmcclient/testutils/hmc_inventory_file.py of the python-zhmcclient project.
#
# HMC inventory files conform to the format of Ansible inventory files in YAML
# format and define specific host attributes for HMCs.
#
# Brief description of the HMC inventory file format:
#
#   all:  # the top-level HMC group
#     hosts:
#       <hmc_name>:  # DNS hostname, IP address, or nickname of HMC
#         description: <string>
#         contact: <string>
#         access_via: <string>
#         ansible_host: <host>  # if real HMC and nickname is used
#         mock_file: <path_name>  # if mocked HMC
#         cpcs:  # expected CPCs managed by the HMC
#           <cpc_name>:  # CPC name
#             <prop_name>: <prop_value>  # expected CPC properties
#         <var_name>: <var_value>  # additional variables for HMC
#     vars:
#       <var_name>: <var_value>  # additional variables for all HMCs in group
#     children:
#       <group_name>:  # a child HMC group
#         hosts: ...  # variables are inherited from parent group
#         vars: ...
#         children: ...
#
# Notes for this example file:
# * To use this example file, copy it to `~/.zhmc_inventory.yaml` which is the
#   default path name used.
