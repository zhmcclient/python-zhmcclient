# HMC inventory file for zhmcclient projects
#
# This file defines real HMCs and mocked HMCs (using the zhmcclient mock
# support) for use by the zhmcclient projects. Their credentials are defined
# in a corresponding HMC vault file.
#
# The format of HMC inventory files is described in
# https://python-zhmcclient.readthedocs.io/en/master/development.html#hmc-inventory-file
