Fixed that incorrect type in filter arguments of 'list()', etc. no longer
results in TypeError. For client-side filtering, the filter arguments are now
converted to the type of the property value, before matching the filter, for
property types bool, int, float, and str. For bool, the string values 'TRUE' and
'FALSE' are interpreted (case insensitively) as the corresponding boolean values.
This provides more flexibility in environments such as the command line or
Ansible. Match values that cannot be converted cause a new exception
'zhmcclient.FilterConversionError' to be raised, in order to provide the user
with a way to catch such situations. Note that for server-side filtering,
the provided filter arguments were already converted to string because they
are passed as URI query parameters, so a type tolerance already existed for
such filter arguments.
