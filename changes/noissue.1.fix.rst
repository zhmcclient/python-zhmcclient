Fixed installation errors on Python 3.13 by increasing the minimum versions of
install dependencies PyYAML to 6.0.2, pyrsistent to 0.20.0 and wheel to 0.41.3.
This was done for all Python versions, to simplify dependencies.
Increased the minimum versions of some development dependencies for the same
reason.
