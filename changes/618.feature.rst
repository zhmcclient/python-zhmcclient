Added support for using the integrated ASCII console of operating systems
running in partitions in DPM mode via the WebSocket protocol, by adding a new
method 'zhmcclient.Partition.create_os_websocket()'.
Added a new documentation section "Using WebSocket to access OS console" that
documents how to interact with the integrated ASCII console from Python code.
