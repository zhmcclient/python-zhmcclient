Added support for Partition Links with a new 'zhmcclient.PartitionLink'
resource class (and corresponding manager class). Added the following
methods for partition links to the 'zhmcclient.Partition' class:
'attach_network_link()', 'detach_network_link()',
'attach_ctc_link()', 'detach_ctc_link()', 'list_attached_partition_links()'.
