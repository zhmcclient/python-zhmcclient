Install: Removed dependency to the Python package "pytz", which was used
by the zhmcclient package, and replaced that with standard Python's
:class:`py:datetime.timezone` class. Testcases were converted to use standard
Python's :module:`py:zoneinfo` module (which requires installing the 'tzdata'
package on Windows). Since the :module:`py:zoneinfo` module was added in
Python 3.9, test functions that need this module are skipped on Python 3.8.
