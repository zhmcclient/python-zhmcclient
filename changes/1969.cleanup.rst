Install: Removed dependency to the Python package "pytz", which was used
by the zhmcclient package, and replaced that with standard Python's
"datetime.timezone" module. Testcases were converted to use standard
Python's "zoneinfo" module (which requires installing the 'tzdata' package on
Windows). Since the "zoneinfo" module was added in Python 3.9, test functions
that need this module are skipped on Python 3.8.
