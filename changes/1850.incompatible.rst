The fix that incorrect types of match values in filter arguments of 'list()',
'findall()' and 'find()' no longer result in 'TypeError' has the implication
that providing such incorrect types is now treated differently, resulting
in an incompatibility: If possible the match value gets its type converted to
the type of the property value. Otherwise, a new exception
'zhmcclient.FilterConversionError' is raised.
Note that this incompatibility only applies when the types of match values in
filter arguments are incorrect for the property values. If they are correct,
there is no incompatibility.
