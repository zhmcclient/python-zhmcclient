Mock: Fixed that resource properties returned from zhmcclient mock support
were not independent of the internal resource object's state. For properties
that are lists or dicts, that has lead to the issue that changes to the
internal state of the (mocked) resource object were immediately visible
to a user that had previouly obtained the resource properties.
