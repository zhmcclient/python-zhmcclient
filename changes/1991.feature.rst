The content length after which truncation of data happens in log entries for
HMC requests and responses is now configurable via a new parameter
``log_content_truncate`` of the :class:`~zhmcclient.RetryTimeoutConfig`
configuration, and its default value has been increased to 500000 Bytes (from
the hard coded 30000 Bytes).
