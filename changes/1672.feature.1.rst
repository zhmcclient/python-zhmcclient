Added a resource class 'zhmcclient.HwMessage' and corresponding manager
class 'zhmcclient.HwMessageManager' to support hardware messages. The
hardware messages are accessible for CPC and Console via a new property
'hw_messages'. A HwMessage object supports list() and find..() methods,
property retrieval, 'delete()', 'request_service()',
'get_service_information()' and 'decline_service()'. Added end2end and unit
tests.
