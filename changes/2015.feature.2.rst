Simplified the way users can write pytest based test programs using the
pytest fixtures in zhmcclient.testutils: These pytest fixtures no longer need
to be imported before using them, because they are now delivered as a pytest
plugin and are thus globally known by pytest. In addition, the scope of these
pytest fixtures was widened from 'module' to 'session'. This reduces the
number of HMC sessions that pytest based test programs use, because they now
are reused across test modules. User-written test programs that import these
fixtures will still run unchanged, but in order to take advantage of the
reduced number of HMC sessions, these test programs need to remove the import
statements for the fixtures, because importing them causes pytest to reduce
their scope to 'module' again.
