Dev: Migrated from a manually maintained change log file to using change
fragment files with the 'towncrier' package. This simplifies the procedures
for starting and releasing a version, and avoids merge conflicts when there
are multiple Pull Requests at the same time. For details, read the new
'Making a change' section in the documentation.
