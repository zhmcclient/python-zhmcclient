Incompatible changes in the notification support:

- The 'NotificationReceiver.notifications()' method now continues running when
  there are no notifications, and only ever returns when
  'NotificationReceiver.close()' is called (in some other thread).
  Before this change, the method returned when there were no notifications, so
  it had to be invoked by the user in a loop. Such user code should be adjusted
  to remove the loop and deal with the return indicating a close of the
  receiver.

- In addition, the 'NotificationReceiver.notifications()' method can now raise
  the new exceptions 'zhmcclient.NotificationConnectionError' and
  'zhmcclient.NotificationSubscriptionError'.

- The 'NotificationReceiver.subscribe/unsubscribe()' methods can now raise the
  new exception 'zhmcclient.NotificationSubscriptionError'.

- Note that the 'NotificationReceiver.close()' method can raise
  'stomp.exception.StompException'. This could already be raised before this
  change, but had not been documented before.
