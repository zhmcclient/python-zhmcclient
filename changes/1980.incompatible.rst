Changed the type of :attr:`zhmcclient.BaseResource.properties` from
``immutable_views.DictView`` to :class:`id:immutabledict.immutabledict`.
Both classes inherit from ``Mapping`` and are compatible with ``dict``.
This change may be incompatible if you perform type comparisons or inheritance
checks using the ``immutable_views.DictView`` class. Apart from that, this
change should be compatible.
