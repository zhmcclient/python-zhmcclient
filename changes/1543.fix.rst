Docs: Fixed the description of the 'Cpc.list_associated_storage_groups()'
method; it previously had stated that when the "dpm-storage-management" firmware
feature is not enabled, the method would be returning an empty list. That was
corrected in the documentation to match the actual behavior, which is to
fail.
