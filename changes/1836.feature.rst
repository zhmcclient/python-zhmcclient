When a 'list()' method specific full_properties=True, the retrieval of the
resource properties in the list result is implemented using the bulk operation
"Submit Requests". That operation has a limit for the request size of 256 kB.
So far, that limit could not possibly be reached. The support for hardware
messages made it necessary to improve that implementation by splitting the
bulk operation into multiple operations when the request size limit is
exceeded.
