End2end test: Specifying a CPC in an HMC entry of the HMC inventory file that
is not managed by the HMC now causes pytest to error out. Previously, the CPC
was skipped and a warning was issued. This is to better indicate that the
expectation of the HMC inventory file was not met by the actual environment.
