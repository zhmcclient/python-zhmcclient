Added list_firmware_features() to the Cpc and Partition classes. The firmware
feature data is cached. The method lists the enabled firmware features
regardless of the HMC/SE version and regardless of whether the firmware
feature is available. If the HMC/SE version does not support firmware
features yet (2.14 and HMC API version 2.23), an empty list is returned.
