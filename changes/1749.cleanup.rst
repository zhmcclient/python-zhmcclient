End2end test: In the test method 'test_partlink_zzz_cleanup()' which cleans
up partition links and partitions from previous runs, added the recommendation
to open zhmcclient issue in its message reporting partition links or partitions
that had to be cleaned up. The partition link names have been changed to
indicate which test method produced them. The test method
'test_partlink_zzz_cleanup()' stays in place for the time being, as an
additional safety net.
