Added support for running the 'bandit' checker with a new make target
'bandit', and added that to the GitHub Actions test workflow. Adjusted
the code in order to pass the bandit check:

  - Changed the use of 'yamlloader.ordereddict.Loader' to 'SafeLoader'.
  - Added bandit ignore markers where appropriate.
